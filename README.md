# Bulldozer Sale Price Regression Prediciton

This is a jupyter notebook that utilizes regression techniques to predict the sale price of bulldozers using historical data.  There are many features, but a lot of missing data as only some of data points were able to be collected for each sample.

The notebook is diveded into sections detailing the actions being taken.

The data is collected from a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers).

# Hi, I'm John! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a business analyst at a major health insurance organization.  I'm very interested in data science as a tool to turn data into digestable information that people want to learn about.  I've worked in healthcare for over half a decade, but I also hold interests in music, cooking, and housing.

I've been spending the last year and a half learning Python, SQL, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn in my free time to improve my data analysis and data science skills.  While I continue to build those skills, I've been learning recently about Tableau, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
