# Bulldozer Sale Price Regression Prediciton

This is a jupyter notebook that utilizes regression techniques to predict the sale price of bulldozers using historical data.  In this project, I focused on improving my data cleaning and feature engineering skillset.  There are many features and a lot of missing data as only some of data points were able to be collected for each sample.

The notebook is diveded into sections detailing the actions being taken.

The data is collected from a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers).
